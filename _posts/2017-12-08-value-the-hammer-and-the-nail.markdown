A common question I’m asked about cryptocurrencies is “where does it receive its value?” “What is it worth?”  These are challenging questions because most of the experts have different explanations. I have my own explanation after much research but will save my opinions for the end. However, I will introduce a thought experiment that I believe explains the true value of anything.

Imagine you and a friend decide to escape society by moving off the grid to live off the land. In haste, you both rush off into the woods to start a new life. In a rush, you only grab your favorite hammer and your friend grabs his 10 nails. It’s a stretch of the imagination, but just go with it! As you start to travel deep into the woods you notice the clouds are rapidly turning dark and realize you’ll both need shelter for protection from the elements. Magically, two piles of lumber appear! You now have all the necessary materials to build a shelter. Complicating the matter, your friend is gassy because he had a bean burrito for breakfast. Things get chaotic after you insult his flatulence and now he insists you both have your own shelters. There is lumber, a hammer, and ten nails. You have something he needs and he has something you need. 

Both the hammer and the nails are valuable because they are both necessary to build each shelter. You and your friend come to an agreement that is equally beneficial.  Your friend loans you five nails in exchange for renting your hammer to complete his shelter. This arrangement allows you both to successfully build shelters and survive the stormy night. 

You and your friend wake up the next morning hungry with nothing to eat. After much thought, you figure that you could probably hunt with your hammer. Still insulted, your friend humbly suggests that he’ll clean your shelter in exchange for you sharing your kill. Your hammer is now the most valuable item in the relationship between you and your friend. Unless your friend becomes wise and leaves you in the woods to return to society, he will be indebted to you and the hammer.

It an oversimplification, but crypto is like the hammer. It’s being used in the exchange of goods and services. Additionally, it is a driving force in disrupting how financial services operate. The banks are scrambling, like your friend, trying to delegitimize the value of your hammer, because their value is held up in existing structures. It was by chance you grab the hammer and the circumstances proved to be the key to prospering your asset. Similarly, buying crypto is a chance that is ripe for circumstances that continue to drive up the prices. Just the like the hammer, more uses could be found that will further drive up the value. Those who own the hammers are in the woods escaping society as we know it.
