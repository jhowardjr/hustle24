Here's a quick tutorial on how to purchase cryptocurrency, also called digital currency, using [Coinbase].

## Download the Coinbase app on your mobile device

Coinbase is currently the most favored platform for purchasing digital currency. If you search for the term bitcoin in the Apple app store or Google play, Coinbase is likely to be the displayed first in the search results. You can also click on one the following links:

## Visit the Coinbase website

Alternatively, you can also go to the Coinbase website at [https://www.coinbase.com/](https://www.coinbase.com/). It may be easier setting up your accounts and security by going directly to the site instead of using a mobile device. Additionally, there is more information provided about Coinbase and digital currency on the site.

## Buying Bitcoin from the app

Once you have the app installed and open, the first screen you'll see is a dashboard. The dashboard is a quick glance of the current price of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC). The chart listed under each currency displays the percentage the currency's price has increased or decreased for the day. There is also a line graph displaying the fluctuation of the price throughout the day. The buy button for all the currencies is at the bottom in the middle of the toolbar.

### Click buy

When you click the buy button you'll be taken to the initial purchase screen. There you should select which currency you want to trade. Then select which account you want to use to buy the currency. If you use a bank account the weekly purchase limit is higher than the alternative which is a credit or debit card. Also, using a bank account the purchases are not immediately reflected in your bank account. After selecting the account, you will enter how much money (USD) you wish to spend in the left input field.

### Execute the buy

Finally, before executing the trade take notice of some important information. 

1) The value next to BTC is how much of the currency you will be purchasing. To get that number you divide USD minus 3% Coinbase fee divided by the current BTC price. For example, on this screen I'm buying $25 and my fee is $1.49 so my buying power is $23.51. Divide $23.51 by the current bitcoin price $10,024.90 you should get BTC 0.00234516.

2) Always be aware of the fees. Currently, its at 3% when you make a buy or sell transaction.

3) Your trade isn't executed until you click the buy button in the top right corner or at the bottom.

### Check your balance

At this point you should own some bitcoin! Return to the dashboard screen and check your balance on the accounts screen. On the accounts screen you'll see how much BTC, ETH, and LTC you own and how much it's currently worth. Keep in mind digital currency is currently very volatile and a higher risk than standard investments. However, investing money that otherwise would be thrown away on frivolous consumption may be worth it in the long run.
