Are you curious if crypto mining is the best move for you? On the surface, it makes sense you can create “free” digital currency and exchange it for real money. However, there is no free lunch. There’s a cost for the equipment. There’s a cost for the power to run the equipment. There’s a cost in time to educate yourself on keeping your equipment competitive in multiple markets. The challenge is to reduce the initial cost, quickly recover that initial cost, and then create a profit higher than what could have been made through buying in the exchange.

First, I found some reputable rig equipment list. In general, the rig consisted of the following type of equipment: 

* Motherboard
* Processor
* Memory
* Storage
* Case
* Power Supplies
* Cables
* GPUs

I thought maybe I’d cash out some of my existing cryptos and build a mining rig where I could quickly turn profitable in emerging alt-coins. Subsequently, I’d then convert those profits into one of the majors like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or Litecoin (LTC). The first seven items quickly totaled $800 to $1000. At this point, I felt building a mining machine would be reasonable until I search around for graphical processing units (GPU). Most crypto rigs for mining alt coins that proclaimed to be profitable had at least six GPUs. I looked everywhere online, but I couldn’t get the GPU cost below an additional $1500. In fact, I couldn’t even find six GPUs of the same type. I reasoned in my mind the total cost of $2300 to $2500, while expensive, was worth the risk. Any investment strategy incurs some risk I reasoned. 

Another concern I read about often involved the price of powering a mining rig. In conversation , people have consistently cited power consumption as the major hurdle to doing any crypto mining. There is a cost, but I found it mostly manageable in the context of building a simple rig where you connect with a mining pool. Based on my current location, using the rig specifications above I estimate the cost for running the mining rig would increase my power bill by $100. Perhaps the major power issues everyone mentions becomes a major issue when trying to scale up operations. 

Lastly, if you’ve never built a computer before it would be smart to educate yourself on that process. I’m certain that people lose a lot of money through trial and error trying to build a mining rig that can eventually become profitable. You can easily damage the equipment if proper care isn’t taken when putting together a functioning computer. Rig owners describe equipment smoking, melting and on fire on several occasions.

Based on what I’ve researched given the general specifications above I estimate my hashing power could land anywhere between 1500 - 2500 hashes per second (H/s). I couldn’t justify making the investment and building the mining rig. Using the mining calculator at [www.cryptocompare.com](www.cryptocompare.com), I found with those hash rates there would be negative profit for most the coins listed except for Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC). Given an initial cost of $2500 and $100 a month for the power bill, I would possibly see a profit four to six months later. Then I wondered how the current conversations about net neutrality could or would affect mining operations in the USA. I wondered what would I do if there was an equipment fire when I'm not around. I wondered in that time period before becoming profitable how long being profitable would last for emerging alt-coins. So, for now, I’ll stick with the strategy that has been working for me, which is consistently buying into the majors in small increments on a weekly basis and also making investments into the companies selling the equipment necessary to mine.
